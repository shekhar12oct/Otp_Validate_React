🔐 OTP Input UI Component (Frontend Only)
A clean and interactive OTP (One-Time Password) input UI component built purely on the frontend — no backend or API integrations involved.

What it does:

Provides a user-friendly OTP input interface

Validates OTP length and format on the client side

Mimics the real-world mobile OTP input experience

Key Features:

🔢 Customizable number of input boxes (e.g., 4 or 6 digits)

⌨️ Auto-focus & seamless input navigation

⏪ Handles backspace and arrow keys intuitively

📋 Supports pasting the full OTP

⚠️ Basic client-side validation for correct OTP length

Ideal for prototyping, UI showcases, or integrating into larger flows where API/backend will be connected later.
